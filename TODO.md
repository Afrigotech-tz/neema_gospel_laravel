# TODO: Implement Device Fingerprinting for IP Throttling

## Completed Steps
- [x] Create migration to add 'fingerprint' column and update unique constraint to composite (ip_address, fingerprint)
- [x] Update IpThrottle model to include 'fingerprint' in fillable
- [x] Modify IpThrottleMiddleware to generate device fingerprint and use composite key for throttling

## Pending Steps
- [x] Run the migration: `php artisan migrate`
- [ ] Test the throttling with different devices (e.g., different browsers or devices from same IP)
- [ ] Monitor logs for any errors or unexpected behavior
- [ ] Optionally, update config/ipthrottle.php to use dynamic thresholds and integrate with middleware instead of hardcoded values
